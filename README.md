# YoutubeDownloader
Average YouTube downloader made with Python.

## Deprecated
This project is deprecated as of 9/2/2024, 11:52 P.M. (GMT +3) due to Python being not enough. I will try and do the same project with C++, or C#. If I fail to do so, I will unarchive the project and keep developing it.

## Known issues
YouTube's safeguard might tag you as a bot, and since this program is an open-source one, I can't really make a workaround since the easiest workaround to this that I know is by including cookies, so the library can disguise as an actual account. But, that would make it risky for my own safety.

## Dependencies
PIL, Requests, yt-dlp, customtkinter
