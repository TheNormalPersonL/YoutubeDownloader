# YoutubeDownloader
Average YouTube downloader made with Python.

## Known issues
YouTube's safeguard might tag you as a bot, and since this program is an open-source one, I can't really make a workaround since the easiest workaround to this that I know is by including cookies, so the library can disguise as an actual account. But, that would make it risky for my own safety.

## Dependencies
PIL, Requests, yt-dlp, customtkinter

## Version
This is the first version to ever come off. I am planning to update the code to include more download options, with UI optimizations, and more.
